What are my strengths?

Strengths

Communication and Stakeholder Engagement
I have worked closely with a wide range of stakeholders, from Defence projects to retail management at Carpet Call. I make an effort to listen carefully, understand their needs, and find practical solutions that meet both technical and business goals. I value teamwork and always aim to maintain clear and open communication with customers and colleagues. This ability to connect with people while applying technical understanding has helped me build strong working relationships and deliver positive outcomes.


What are my areas for development/gaps?

Areas for Development

1. Planning and Prioritisation Skills
While I manage my workload effectively, I see room to further develop my planning and prioritisation skills. I aim to improve in setting clearer timelines, breaking down tasks more efficiently, and anticipating challenges earlier in the process. Strengthening these skills will help me work more strategically and maintain consistency across larger or more complex projects.

2. Technical Skills through Further Training and Exposure
I have a average technical foundation, but I believe continuous learning and exposure to different technologies will help me grow further. I am particularly interested in enhancing my technical depth in areas such as coding skills, , automation, architecture  and scalable system design. I plan to build on my current knowledge through hands-on experience, additional training opportunities.

Limit your response to 200 words or less



In my graduate role, I consistently ensure that my work aligns with the broader objectives of the Department. When contributing to digital solutions, I actively consider how my tasks support team and organisational goals, such as improving operational efficiency through ServiceNow automation and data reporting. I engage with stakeholders to understand their needs and anticipate potential challenges, helping to inform project planning and decision-making. For example, by identifying workflow inefficiencies and proposing practical solutions, I have contributed to smoother operations and better outcomes for end-users. I also collaborate closely with team members, sharing insights and progress updates to maintain alignment with project objectives. Through these activities, I not only complete my individual responsibilities but also support the strategic direction of the team by thinking ahead, highlighting potential risks, and suggesting improvements. This approach demonstrates my ability to link day-to-day tasks with broader organisational priorities, while actively participating in planning and problem-solving processes.

Manage priorities, meet deadlines and adapt to changing demands.


In my graduate role, I focus on delivering high-quality work while making the best use of the resources and tools available. I plan my tasks carefully, set clear priorities, and communicate regularly with stakeholders to make sure deadlines are met. For example, when developing dashboards and reports in ServiceNow, I often needed to balance competing priorities and adapt to changes in project requirements. I stay flexible when unexpected challenges arise, quickly adjusting my approach to keep work on track. By paying attention to progress and finding practical solutions to problems, I make sure my work meets team and organisational expectations. This experience has helped me build the ability to manage my workload effectively, respond to changing demands, and consistently deliver results.

In my graduate role, I actively work to build and maintain effective relationships with both colleagues and stakeholders. During my first rotation in ServiceNow, I collaborated closely with team members and end-users to understand their needs and ensure solutions met their requirements. In my current rotation with the Gunnery team, I work as a software developer alongside technical and operational staff to design and develop a new application. I make an effort to listen to different perspectives, value diversity, and work cooperatively to achieve shared goals. By fostering open communication, showing respect for others’ expertise, and supporting my team wherever possible, I contribute to a positive and productive work environment. These experiences have helped me strengthen my ability to work effectively across teams and with a variety of stakeholders.

Capability
Demonstrate professionalism and a strong work ethic.
Behaviour
Take responsibility for action, be resilient and seek development.





In my graduate role, I consistently strive to demonstrate professionalism and a strong work ethic. I take responsibility for my tasks and ensure they are completed to a high standard, whether it involves analysing business requirements, improving workflows, or contributing to the design and development of new applications. I approach challenges with resilience, adapting to changing requirements or unexpected issues, and I consistently look for ways to expand my programming knowledge to improve the quality and performance of my work. By being accountable, persistent, and committed to ongoing growth, I contribute positively to my team and uphold the standards expected within the organisation.











Core Competency 5
Communicates with Influence
Key capabilities and behaviours required at APS5 level
Capability
Communicate clearly and tailor messages to the audience.
Behaviour
Listen actively, engage others respectfully and present information confidently.



In my current rotation, I focus on communicating technical information clearly and in a way that is accessible to different audiences. I make an effort to explain technical terms in plain language and clearly outline changes or updates to previous users, helping to improve their experience and interaction with the software. I also actively listen to feedback and questions, engage respectfully with colleagues and stakeholders, and present information in a confident and structured manner. By adapting my communication style to suit the audience, I help build understanding, foster collaboration, and ensure that both technical and non-technical stakeholders are well-informed and able to make the most of the software.




Feature	Simile	Metaphor
Type of comparison	Explicit	Implicit
Uses “like” or “as”	Yes	No
Clarity	Usually clearer and more direct	Can be more figurative or symbolic
Impact	Softer, descriptive	Stronger, more vivid
Use in formal government writing	More common when clarity is required	Used sparingly to avoid ambiguity

Purpose in Writing (Relevant to Government Style)
Simile

Supports clarity, a core requirement in government communication.

Useful when explaining unfamiliar or complex ideas in simple terms.

Metaphor

Can improve reader engagement.

Should be used carefully, ensuring the meaning remains clear and not overly decorative.

4. Summary Statement

A simile compares one thing to another using “like” or “as,” making the comparison clear and straightforward. A metaphor describes one thing as if it were another, creating a stronger and more figurative expression. Both are forms of figurative language, but similes prioritise clarity, while metaphors prioritise impact.
















I apply a structured and analytical approach to problem-solving by breaking down complex issues into manageable components, validating assumptions with system data and logs, and focusing on identifying the root cause rather than applying short-term fixes. I consider the broader operational and user impact of every decision, ensuring that solutions are both technically robust and aligned with business needs. When requirements are unclear, I proactively seek clarification, anticipate edge cases, and document findings to reduce future risk. This mindset allows me to deliver efficient, reliable outcomes in fast-paced technical environments while maintaining clarity and confidence in communication with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
