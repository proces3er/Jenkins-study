What are my strengths?

Strengths

Communication and Stakeholder Engagement
I have worked closely with a wide range of stakeholders, from Defence projects to retail management at Carpet Call. I make an effort to listen carefully, understand their needs, and find practical solutions that meet both technical and business goals. I value teamwork and always aim to maintain clear and open communication with customers and colleagues. This ability to connect with people while applying technical understanding has helped me build strong working relationships and deliver positive outcomes.


What are my areas for development/gaps?

Areas for Development

1. Planning and Prioritisation Skills
While I manage my workload effectively, I see room to further develop my planning and prioritisation skills. I aim to improve in setting clearer timelines, breaking down tasks more efficiently, and anticipating challenges earlier in the process. Strengthening these skills will help me work more strategically and maintain consistency across larger or more complex projects.

2. Technical Skills through Further Training and Exposure
I have a average technical foundation, but I believe continuous learning and exposure to different technologies will help me grow further. I am particularly interested in enhancing my technical depth in areas such as coding skills, , automation, architecture  and scalable system design. I plan to build on my current knowledge through hands-on experience, additional training opportunities.

In 12 to 18 months, I would like to have developed stronger technical and analytical skills and become more confident and mature in programming and coding. I aim to take on more complex technical tasks within my current team and contribute more independently to ongoing projects. I also want to continue improving my planning and communication skills so I can work more effectively with colleagues and stakeholders, and provide greater technical value within my current work environment.
